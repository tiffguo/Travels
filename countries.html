It is among the oldest of the world’s great cities—its history spanning nearly two millennia—and one of the most cosmopolitan. London has historically undergone many victories and tragedies, and you can see it reflected in its rich cultural landmarks.

              Santorini, the precious gem of the Aegean, is actually a group of islands in the southernmost part of the Cyclades. The Santorini islands are still an active volcano and the only volcano in the world whose crater is in the sea. Santorini is considered to be the most sought after place for a romantic getaway in Greece and has a growing reputation as a “wedding destination” for couples from all over the world. Hike from Oia to Fira, and indulge in Santorini's ultimate gastronomic experiences. </p>

              <p class="cardwords">Amalfi is a town in a dramatic natural setting below steep cliffs on Italy’s southwest coast. Between the 9th and 11th centuries, it was the seat of a powerful maritime republic. The Arab-Norman Sant'Andrea cathedral at the heart of town, with its striped Byzantine facade, survives from this era. Looking around town and the surrounding hills, you'll quickly see that the primary product of the area is enormous orbs of lemons, picked fresh to make limoncello liqueur and used in local dishes, as well. The lemon motif shows up in regional ceramics and citrus scent fills the air as you meander about.</p>

              <p class="cardwords">Copenhagen is the capital of Denmark and is big enough to be a metropolis with shopping, culture and nightlife par excellence, yet still small enough to be intimate, safe and easy to navigate. Overlooking the Øresund strait with Sweden just minutes away, it is a cultural and geographic link between mainland Europe and Scandinavia. This is where old fairy tales blend with flashy new architecture and world-class design; where warm jazz mixes with cold electronica from Copenhagen's basements. Explore the iconic Nyhavn, Tivoli Gardens, and hipster neighborhoods!</p>
