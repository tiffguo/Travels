              <p class="cardwords">Amalfi is a town in a dramatic natural setting below steep cliffs on Italy’s southwest coast. Between the 9th and 11th centuries, it was the seat of a powerful maritime republic. The Arab-Norman Sant'Andrea cathedral at the heart of town, with its striped Byzantine facade, survives from this era. Looking around town and the surrounding hills, you'll quickly see that the primary product of the area is enormous orbs of lemons, picked fresh to make limoncello liqueur and used in local dishes, as well. The lemon motif shows up in regional ceramics and citrus scent fills the air as you meander about.</p>

Overlooking the Øresund strait with Sweden just minutes away, it is a cultural and geographic link between mainland Europe and Scandinavia. This is where old fairy tales blend with flashy new architecture and world-class design; where warm jazz mixes with cold electronica from Copenhagen's basements.

Toronto is also known for its ethnic and cultural diversity, its world-famous professional sports teams,</p>

                <p class="cardwords">Beijing, China’s sprawling capital, has history stretching back 3 millennia. Yet it’s known as much for modern architecture as its ancient sites such as the grand Forbidden City complex, the imperial palace during the Ming and Qing dynasties. Nearby, the massive Tiananmen Square pedestrian plaza is the site of Mao Zedong’s mausoleum and the National Museum of China, displaying a vast collection of cultural relics. I came here as part of an immersion program to understand my Chinese heritage, and the experience was unforgettable.</p>
